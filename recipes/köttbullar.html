    <p>Sweden’s national dish made worldwide famous in IKEA restaurants is a classic!

        The recipe is simple and goes way back: minced pork or beef, onion, egg, milk, and breadcrumbs.
        Mixed and fried in a generous amount of butter, it’s traditionally served with mashed potato, lingonberry jam, and brown cream sauce.

        As with most Swedish food the meatballs are only lightly seasoned. Salt and pepper are generally considered enough. 

        The traditional meatball has a very important role in Swedish cuisine. It’s served both as an everyday meal and as special meals during the holidays. Christmas, Easter, Midsummer – the meatball will be there along with some other things on this list.
